# Multimedia-Computing
A course project from Multimedia Computing Course at INHA University in Tashkent. Main objective of the project is to use knowledge on Image Processing and Computer Vision, so I tried my best to learn some new techniques in filtering, convolution, and smoothing an image. I tried to come up with an idea to make better Laplacian Filtering by the help of contrast-stretching, dilation and erosion techniques.
